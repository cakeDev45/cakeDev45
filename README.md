### Hello!

I'm Cake, but you can call me whatever you'd like. I'm an indie game developer working on multiple projects at the moment. I specalize in Unreal Engine 4 for the most part. I'm also pretty good at 3D modelling and texturing.

I can code in C#, however I am best at UE4's Blueprints.

Currently working on a big unannounced project.

Here's some other platforms you can follow me on!
