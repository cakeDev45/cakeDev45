### Hello!

I'm Cake, but you can call me whatever you'd like. I'm an indie game developer working on multiple projects at the moment. I specalize in Unreal Engine 4 for the most part. I also try my best at 3D modelling, texturing, and animating.

I can code in C#, however I am best at UE4's Blueprints.

Currently working on Project: Hello Neighbor 2, a Hello Neighbor 2 fan-game.

Here's some other platforms you can follow me on!
